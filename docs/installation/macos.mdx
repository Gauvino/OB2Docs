# Web Client
If you're a MacOS user, you can only use the Web Client. The updater is not available, since unsigned executables are not allowed to run on MacOS.

## Installation on MacOS
First of all, download and install the .NET Runtime and ASP.NET Core Runtime by following [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/macos).

Then, download the latest version of OpenBullet 2

<OBDownloadButton fileName="OpenBullet2.Web.zip">OpenBullet2.Web.zip</OBDownloadButton>

Unzip the archive and open a terminal. `cd` into the folder where you placed the unzipped files. Then execute the following command
```bash
dotnet ./OpenBullet2.Web.dll
```

Wait until it prints the text you see in the picture below

Finally, navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) using your favorite browser and you should see the home page.
