# Web Client
If you're a Windows user, you have the ability to choose between the Web Client and the Native Client to use OpenBullet 2. They are interchangeable, and you can switch from one client to the other at any point in time by simply copying the `UserData` folder. Consider using the Web Client if you're interested in these features

- Good looking interface
- Themes
- Can be configured to be accessed from any device in your LAN or across the internet (if hosted e.g. on a VPS)

## Installation on Windows
<OBDownloadButton fileName="ob2-web-updater-win-x64.exe">Web Updater (win-x64)</OBDownloadButton>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<DotnetDownloadButton version="8.0" fileName="dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe">.NET Runtime (win-x64)</DotnetDownloadButton>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<DotnetDownloadButton version="8.0" fileName="aspnetcore-runtime-win-x64.exe">ASP.NET Core Runtime (win-x64)</DotnetDownloadButton>

Move the updater to a new empty folder, then double-click it to run it.

:::caution Warning
Windows Defender might block the updater from running. If this happens, click on *More info* and then on *Run anyway*. The updater is automatically built through a GitHub Actions pipeline. If for any reason you don't trust it, you can also compile it yourself from the source code.
:::

:::info Info
You could also directly download [**OpenBullet2.Web.zip**](https://github.com/openbullet/openbullet2/releases/latest/download/OpenBullet2.Web.zip), but the updater is recommended since it can be used to easily update your installation in the future.
:::

If you don't have the latest [.NET Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-win-x64.exe) and [ASP.NET Core Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-win-x64.exe) installed on your system, the updater will prompt you to install them. **This is required to run OpenBullet 2 (Web).**

Once the updater is done downloading the latest version of OpenBullet 2, double-click on `OpenBullet2.Web.exe` to start it. A terminal window with colored text should appear. Wait until it prints the text you see in the picture below

Finally, navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) using your favorite browser and you should see the home page.

## Troubleshooting

### OpenBullet 2 closes immediately
If the program closes immediately, it means that the [ASP.NET Core Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-win-x64.exe) was not installed correctly.

### I'm on a 64-bit ARM Windows OS
If you're on a 64-bit ARM Windows OS, follow these steps instead.
1. Download the ARM64 version of the updater from [this link](https://github.com/openbullet/openbullet2/releases/latest/download/ob2-web-updater-win-arm64.exe) and run it.
2. If you don't have it, download the [.NET Runtime for win-arm64](https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/dotnet-runtime-win-arm64.exe) and the [ASP.NET Core Runtime for win-arm64](https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-win-arm64.exe) and install them.
3. Holding down the SHIFT key on your keyboard, right click on an **empty** space inside the folder and select *Open PowerShell window here*
4. Type the following command and press ENTER
```bash
dotnet ./OpenBullet2.Web.dll
```

### I'm on a 32-bit Windows OS
If you're still on a 32-bit Windows OS, follow these steps instead.
1. Download the 32-bit version of the updater from [this link](https://github.com/openbullet/openbullet2/releases/latest/download/ob2-web-updater-win-x86.exe).
2. If you don't have it, download the [.NET Runtime for win-x86](https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-win-x86.exe) and the [ASP.NET Core Runtime for win-x86](https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-win-x86.exe) for 32-bit Windows and install them.
3. Holding down the SHIFT key on your keyboard, right click on an **empty** space inside the folder and select *Open PowerShell window here*
4. Type the following command and press ENTER
```bash
dotnet ./OpenBullet2.Web.dll
```
