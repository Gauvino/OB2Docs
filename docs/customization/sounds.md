# Sounds
OpenBullet 2 can play a sound every time one of your jobs gets a hit.

## Web client
You can test and enable the hit sound in the `Settings` tab, in the `Customization` section.

### Using custom sounds
Simply change the `wwwroot/assets/sounds/hit.wav` file with your own sound file. The file must be a `.wav` file and have the same name as the original one. You may need to refresh the page for the changes to take effect.

## Native client
You can test and enable the hit sound in the `OB Settings` tab, in the `Customization` section.
