# Using proxies

### In the Debugger
You can use a proxy while debugging a config by setting up the test proxy like in the following image.

![Proxy options in the debugger](/img/proxies/debugger-options.png)

### In a Multi Run Job
To use proxies when running a config through a Multi Run Job, you can specify some options that will handle how the proxy pool behaves during the run.

First of all, create or edit an existing Multi Run Job and take a look at the proxy settings section of the job options.

You will see the following options:

![Multi Run Job proxy settings](/img/proxies/multi-run-job-proxy-settings.png)

#### Proxy Mode
The *proxy mode* determines whether proxies are going to be used or not for the run. It can have three values:
- ‚ùå **Off** will not make use of proxies
- ‚úÖ **On** will enforce the use of proxies
- ‚ùî **Default** will use the value configured in the config you are trying to run. More specifically, it corresponds to the value of the **Use Proxies** setting in the proxy settings of the config. See below for a sample screenshot of these settings

#### No more proxies behavior
This option manages how OpenBullet 2 will behave when a bot tries to get a proxy from the pool, but there are no available proxies. This can happen for a few reasons:
- all proxies are being used by other bots, and concurrent mode is turned off
- all proxies have been marked as bad or banned

In this case, you can configure OpenBullet 2 to act in a few different ways:
- **Do nothing**
- **Unban** the existing proxies, without reloading them from the proxy sources
- **Reload** the proxies from the sources

The proxy sources indicate where to take proxies from. See below for an explanation.

#### Shuffle proxies option
When the **shuffle proxies** option is enabled, the order of proxies is randomized every time they are reloaded from their sources. This ensures that the first bot doesn't always use the same proxy across independent runs, promoting a more dynamic and unpredictable proxy rotation.

#### Never ban proxies option
The **never ban proxies** option is designed to work in conjunction with rotating proxies. Since rotating proxies typically involve a few proxies that route traffic through a larger pool of proxies, banning the IP of the entire rotating proxy due to a single banned proxy behind it is not desirable. This option helps prevent such scenarios.

#### Concurrent proxy mode
The **concurrent proxy mode** allows multiple bots to share the same proxy as long as it's not banned. This mode is particularly useful when working with rotating proxies, where a limited number of IPs need to be shared among multiple bots. By enabling this mode, you can ensure that all bots can utilize the available proxies efficiently, without waiting for their turn, which can degrade performance.

#### Reload proxies from sources every...
You can use this option to periodically reload proxies from their sources at set intervals. This is particularly useful when working with remote proxy sources that provide constantly updated and verified proxies, ensuring you always have access to the best ones. If you set the interval to 0 seconds, this feature will be disabled.

#### Proxies will be banned for...
This setting determines the length of time a banned proxy will remain banned. This feature is useful when a specific website consistently bans IP addresses for a set period. If you set the timeout to 0, the proxy will remain banned indefinitely or until another mechanism lifts the ban.

#### Proxy sources
These sources supply the proxies that populate the Proxy Pool, which in turn distributes them to the bots. There are three types of proxy sources:

- üì¶ **Group** utilizes one of the proxy groups configured in the *Proxies* section of OpenBullet 2. This allows you to leverage the [proxy checking](./check-proxies.md) feature, which removes non-functional proxies beforehand
- üìÅ **File** draws proxies from a file on your local filesystem. When proxies are reloaded, the file is read, and proxies are parsed from it, one per line, in the standard proxy syntax
- üåê **Remote** retrieves proxies from a remote endpoint. OpenBullet 2 sends a GET request to the endpoint, expecting a list of proxies in response, one per line, in the standard proxy syntax

If any of these sources become unavailable, OpenBullet 2 will automatically switch to the other sources. If no proxies are found from any source, the software will retry several times with exponential backoff.

### Proxy settings of a Config
In the settings of a Config, you can also specify some options related to the use of proxies.

![Config proxy settings](/img/proxies/config-proxy-settings.png)

#### Use proxies
By ticking the *Use proxies* option, you will configure the config's default setting that regulates whether to use proxies or not. Mind that this can be overridden by the job's *Proxy Mode* setting, so this is simply a suggestion that you make to the final user of the Config.

#### Maximum uses per proxy
This option manages how many times a proxy can be used before it's automatically banned. Use this if the site only allows a set number of attempts before it bans an IP address. If the value is set to 0, the feature is disabled.

#### Ban loop evasion
Sometimes, if you didn't configure your *Keycheck* blocks correctly (e.g., if the site is giving you an error message that you haven't seen before during your tests), a bot that is trying a specific data line might get stuck in a ban loop. This means that the bot will start banning one proxy after the other, independently of their actual working status, just because it thinks that the site is not accepting the proxy.

This can be circumvented by setting up a limit to the number of times that a proxy can be banned for a given data line. Once the limit is reached, the data line is marked as *To Check* and the proxy is banned, letting the bot process the other data lines and effectively "unblocking" it.

Then, you can review the data that was marked as *To Check* and update your *Keycheck* blocks to account for the new response that the site gave you.

It is recommended to set the value of the *ban loop evasion* to a high (but not too high!) number, to prevent false positives, especially when using a lot of free unchecked proxies with average or bad quality.
